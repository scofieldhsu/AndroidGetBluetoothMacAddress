# AndroidGetBluetoothMacAddress

<Android device identification â€“ get Wifi/Bluetooth MAC address>

* Android has added read MAC address protection, LOCAL_MAC_ADDRESS, since Android M 6.0. 
So if you call Wifi/Bluetooth API to get their MAC addresses, you will get the default MAC address, 
DEFAULT_MAC_ADDRESS = "02:00:00:00:00:00".
